    "description": "What does it mean to sound historical? How do podcast creators capitalize on the sonic aesthetics of particular time periods to legitimize certain information? This curation explores these questions through a journey through the aesthetics of 1930s radio drama. In the first part of the curation, I offer a brief history of radio and examine three core aspects that defined 1930s radio drama aesthetics: music, voice, and noise. In the second part of the curation, I shift to an analysis of Jill Lepore's 2020 podcast The Last Archive in order to trace how the podcast utilizes the 1930s radio aesthetic for its historical reenactments. This curation concludes by considering the implications of Lepore's strategy for contemporary understandings of history. ",
